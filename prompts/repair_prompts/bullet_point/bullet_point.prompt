You are an expert at repairing Rust Code.
You will be provided with Rust code in the format:

{{file_name.rs}}
```rust
// Input Rust code
```

After the Rust code, you will be given the errors obtained from the compiler corresponding to the Rust code, and you may also be given Rust interface definitions and tests.

{{Feedback.compile}}
```bash
// Compile Feedback
```

I need you to repair the provided Rust files.
Please follow the instructions provided below:
  - You MUST produce the entire file when repairing it and not just the intended change.
  - You MUST NOT change the function signatures of the Rust code.
  - You MUST keep module paths and public APIs exactly as in the provided interface files (if present).
  - You MUST address each error by reasoning about it.
  - Each error MUST be solved using safe Rust code.
  - The repaired Rust code MUST compile successfully and the provided tests MUST pass.
  - The repaired Rust code MUST NOT contain Foreign Function Interface calls, such as the libc library.
  - You must ensure that you import the required files that are referenced in each Rust file.
  - You may derive traits for the data types that are defined, to elicit required behavior during implementation. For instance you can add #[derive(Clone)] for structs when the Clone trait is required for implementation.
  - If you define macros, use `macro_rules!` and re-export via `pub(crate) use` or `#[macro_export]` when needed. Do NOT write `pub(crate) macro_rules!`.
  - All imports in the rust project must be in the following format
  - ```rust
      use crate::file_name::module;
    ```

Return your final solution for each transpiled file in the following format, ensuring that all files include complete, runnable code rather than code fragments.

<final_solution>
{{file_name1.rs}} 
```rust
// Generated Rust Code
```
{{file_name2.rs}} 
```rust
// Generated Rust Code
```
